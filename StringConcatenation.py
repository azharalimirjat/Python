"""
STRING CONCATENATION:
    This means combining/Addition of two or more string together by using (+) sign.
EX:

"""
firstname = "Azhar"
lastname = "Ali"
fullname = firstname+lastname
print(fullname) #(Output will be AzharAli) => this is known as String Concatenation


# Concatenation of two or more numbers used as numbers
a = "1"
b = "2"
print(a+b) #Ouput will be ( "12" )


# We can also use another String b/w addition of two or more Strings
# EX:
fname = "Azhar "
lname = "Mirjat"
print(fname+"Ali "+lname) #Ouput ( "Azhar Ali Mirjat" )

# Note==> You have to define space by yourself otherwise Strings concatenated will be merged

"""
String Concatenation by Multiplying:
    By multiplying any number with string you will get that number times the string
EX"
"""
char = "x"
print(char*10) #Output ( "xxxxxxxxxx" ) ten times 'x'
